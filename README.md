# Passport-23AndMe

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mko/passport-23andme.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [23AndMe's Personal Genome API](https://api.23andme.com) using the OAuth 2.0 API.

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-23andme

## Usage

### Requirements

    var passport = require('passport')
    var TwentThreeAndMeStrategy = require('passport-23andme').Strategy
    var session = require('express-session')

### Middleware

`session` is no longer bundled with Express and must be installed separately.

    app.use(session({ 
      secret: 'anything you want here', resave: false, saveUninitialized: true 
    }))
    app.use(passport.initialize())
    app.use(passport.session())

### Model

We will be using a `findorcreate` plugin during configuration. Make sure your User model has at least a `userId` field set.

    // inside your user model

    var findOrCreate = require('mongoose-findorcreate')
    var userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      userId: String
    })

    userSchema.plugin(findOrCreate)

    var User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

    module.exports = User

#### Configure Strategy

The 23AndMe Personal Genome API authentication strategy authenticates users using a 23AndMe Personal Genome API account and
OAuth tokens.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts these
credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as `options` specifying a
consumer key, consumer secret, and callback URL.

    passport.use(new TwentyThreeAndMeStrategy({
        clientID: TWENTYTHREEANDME_CONSUMER_KEY,
        clientSecret: TWENTYTHREEANDME_CONSUMER_SECRET,
        callbackURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/23andme/callback",
        scope: "basic names haplogroups"
      },
      function(token, tokenSecret, profile, done) {
        User.findOrCreate({ userId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'23andme'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.get('/auth/23andme',
      passport.authenticate('23andme'),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to 23AndMe Personal Genome API for authentication, so this
        // function will not be called.
      });

    app.get('/auth/23andme/callback',
      passport.authenticate('23andme', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });
